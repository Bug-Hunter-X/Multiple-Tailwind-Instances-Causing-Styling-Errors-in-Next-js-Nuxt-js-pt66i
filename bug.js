This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses a build process. The problem usually arises when there are multiple instances of Tailwind CSS configured in your project. For example, a plugin might inadvertently add another instance, leading to conflicts and unexpected behavior.  The error manifests as missing styles or styles being applied incorrectly. You might get runtime errors or warnings related to duplicate class names.
