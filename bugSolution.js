The solution involves carefully reviewing your Tailwind CSS configuration and build process. 

1. **Verify `tailwind.config.js`:** Ensure you have only one properly configured `tailwind.config.js` file.
2. **Check Plugins:** Examine any plugins you are using; some might introduce their own Tailwind configurations. Disable or review these plugins to identify potential conflicts. 
3. **Purge Unused Styles:**  If you're using a purge function, make sure it accurately identifies the styles being used in your application. 
4. **Framework-Specific Configuration:** Consult your framework's documentation (Next.js, Nuxt.js, etc.) for instructions on correctly integrating Tailwind CSS and avoiding common configuration errors. 
5. **Clean Build:** In many cases, a clean build will resolve leftover artifacts from previous configurations.
