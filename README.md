# Multiple Tailwind Instances in Next.js/Nuxt.js

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS with Next.js or Nuxt.js: encountering styling problems due to multiple Tailwind instances configured within the project.  This usually happens due to plugins or conflicting configurations. The example shows the problem and its solution.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where a plugin or additional configuration leads to multiple Tailwind setups, resulting in incorrect or missing styles. This might manifest as broken layouts, missing classes, or unexpected CSS behavior.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected approach. It focuses on ensuring only one instance of Tailwind is properly configured and integrated within your framework's build process.  This typically involves verifying your `tailwind.config.js` file and removing redundant setups or conflicting plugins.
